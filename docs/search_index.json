This is a course taught by Dr. Gavin Fay for the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission: August 16-20, 2021. Description: This training workshop provides fisheries scientists with instruction and hands-on practical modeling experience in an introduction to Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE), for applications to ASMFC (jointly-)managed stocks and participation in MSE technical Committees. MSE is well-recognized approach for strategic decision-making in fisheries management, providing methods to compare among policy options and assess their robustness in meeting a range of management objectives. The objectives of the workshop are to: 1) Provide an overview of the MSE process and components of an MSE, and 2) demonstrate through applied examples and modeling exercises on the components of closed loop simulation analyses that form the basis of the analytical aspects of an MSE. Modeling exercises and case studies will emphasize different aspects and features of MSEs, and a range of examples will emulate features of the stock dynamics and fisheries managed and jointly managed by the ASMFC (possible examples are American lobster, striped bass, summer flounder, menhaden and herring). The workshop will consist of synchronous webinar sessions, with active learning opportunities through discussions and in-class modeling exercises, and additional homework to further develop the case studies explored. The primary focus of the workshop will be on the technical analysis components of MSEs and the interpretation and visualization of results, but the role of stakeholder engagement in MSE processes for co-developing objectives, policy alternatives, and performance metrics will also be overviewed. This website (built in R!) provides access to the workshop materials and will be updated during the workshop as we progress (and adapt).

Breakout sessions and analytical components will be conducted using R. For R, there are two options: either have R &amp; RStudio downloaded on your machine, or use a RStudio Cloud project created for this workshop (recommended). Why RStudio Cloud? We want to maximize time during our workshop for learning, and not on tech support. Using a standard way of interacting with the course material makes this easier, and avoids the hassles of multiple installation types, versions of R, etc. However, you may wish to set up R and RStudio on your local machine, so information about required packages will be posted below. RStudio Cloud Before the workshop, please visit Rstudio Cloud and create a free account. Free accounts give limited usage, but are more than enough for these workshops. Instructions for how to navigate to our RStudio Cloud project and set up the project so you can work on the exercises in your own web browser can be found here. RStudio Cloud set up guide &amp; instructions R &amp; RStudio on own machine Download and install R and RStudio - R: https://cloud.r-project.org/ - RStudio: http://www.rstudio.com/download - Follow your operating system’s normal installation process Getting the workshop materials to your computer You can create a R Studio project from the github repository for the workshop. RStudio project set up guide R Packages used If not using the RStudio Cloud project, we will be using the following R packages and you can install them on your local machine ahead of time by running the below code in the R console (copy &amp; paste). pkgs_to_use &lt;- c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;palmerpenguins&quot;, &quot;furrr&quot;, &quot;MASS&quot;, &quot;janitor&quot;, &quot;skimr&quot;, &quot;Hmisc&quot;, &quot;mvtnorm&quot;, &quot;bookdown&quot;, &quot;RcppRoll&quot;) install.packages(setdiff(pkgs_to_use, rownames(installed.packages()))) Code of Conduct These workshops follow the Fay Lab code of conduct: Licensing All materials are released with Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International license.

Case studies will be based on stocks relevant to course attendees, and our workshop time will include discussions about relevant modeling features, research questions, and stucturing of model scenarios. Each group will select a small number of scenarios to test and present summaries of comparisons at the close of the workshop. These case study projects are meant to provide practical experience with MSE technical analyses but it is encouraged to not make them too complicated, they needn’t reflect every nuance or complexity associated with management of the chosen stock/population. 10.1 Developing objectives &amp; candidate strategies for ASMFC examples 10.2 Relevant OM &amp; HCR needs for case studies Breakout group project coding episode 1 Breakout group project coding episode 2 Project Summaries Developing Operating Models Slides "]]
