_Introduction to Management Strategy Evaluation to support strategic decision-making for fisheries management_: Hello! This is a course taught by Dr. Gavin Fay for the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission: August 16-20, 2021. 

__Description__: This training workshop provides fisheries scientists with instruction and hands-on practical modeling experience in an introduction to Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE), for applications to ASMFC (jointly-)managed stocks and participation in MSE technical Committees. MSE is well-recognized approach for strategic decision-making in fisheries management, providing methods to compare among policy options and assess their robustness in meeting a range of management objectives.

The objectives of the workshop are to: 1) Provide an overview of the MSE process and components of an MSE, and 2) demonstrate through applied examples and modeling exercises on the components of closed loop simulation analyses that form the basis of the analytical aspects of an MSE. 
Modeling exercises and case studies will emphasize different aspects and features of MSEs, and a range of examples will emulate features of the stock dynamics and fisheries managed and jointly managed by the ASMFC (possible examples are American lobster, striped bass, summer flounder, menhaden and herring).

The workshop will consist of synchronous webinar sessions, with active learning opportunities through discussions and in-class modeling exercises, and additional homework to further develop the case studies explored.
The primary focus of the workshop will be on the technical analysis components of MSEs and the interpretation and visualization of results, but the role of stakeholder engagement in MSE processes for co-developing objectives, policy alternatives, and performance metrics will also be overviewed.
